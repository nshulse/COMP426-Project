#  RecipeRealm and Technical Details
RecipeRealm is a website focused on creating a place where people can share their favorite recipes with others and see the recipes nutritional information. Users can create an account and immediately add their favorite recipes to the website. Users can see other recipes that others have added and save them to their My Recipes list for future reference. We used a node js and express backend with knex to interact with a sqlite3 database. For the frontend we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
